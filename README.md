> Alfred Workflow for TensorFlow, PyTorch Python API docs

![demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/vFKqnCdLPNOKc/giphy.gif)

## How does it work
- Workflow will fetch the doc data from Github, then cache the data for a few days

## Commonly used keywords


## Supported Versions
- `ml.json` will be periodically updated to the latest stable versions of TensorFlow & PyTorch

## Keyword Descriptions
- Not supported yet, but will add them in the future. You don't have to update the workflow 

## TODO
- [ ] add Github Actions to generate `ml.json`
- [ ] add keyword descriptions for TensorFlow
- [ ] add keyword descriptions for PyTorch
